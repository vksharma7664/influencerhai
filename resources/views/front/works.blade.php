                            <li>Brand ambassador: Influencers advertise the brand voluntarily, for some perk, and for free out of the great love for the product, manufacturer, or services.</li>

                        <p>&nbsp;</p>

                        <ol>
                            <li>Define Goals</li>
                            <li>Setting up a budget strategy</li>

                        </ol>

                        <h2>1. Define Goals</h2>

                        <p>Outline the purpose of the campaign. In the case of influencer marketing, the main challenge is to increase recognition and attract new customers.</p>

                        <p>&nbsp;</p>

                        <h2>2. Setting up a budget strategy</h2>

                        <p>While setting a budget for an influencer marketing ad campaign, consider the time spent planning, publishing, waiting for the result, and further analysis. Then the brand cost will be limited to providing products to an influencer who will gladly advertise brands as his/her own.</p>

                        <p>&nbsp;</p>

                        <h2>3. Discuss brand goal</h2>

                        <p>In the initial stage of determining the goal, at this stage it is worth narrowing your expectation and looking more concentrated and directed, for ex:</p>

                        <ol>
                            <li>What kind of audience brand is looking for</li>
                            <li>Launch products or brand awareness</li>
                            <li>Launch a new product or relaunch an existing product or remarket on existing products</li>
                        </ol>

                        <p>&nbsp;</p>

                        <h2>4. Analyzing a targeted group to derive business</h2>

                        <p>Once brands have defined their audience, and re-assessment of a selected group, who&#39;re they, specifically brands&#39; potential customers? How much audience reach the brand is looking for? Brand expectation from us in an ongoing ad campaign?</p>

                        <p>&nbsp;</p>

                        <h2>5. Shortlisting influencers</h2>

                        <p>When compiling a list of influencers&#39; suitable for the brand:</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li>Trust of audience among influencers</li>
                            <li>Engagement percentage - Either subscribers are genuine or bots</li>
                            <li>The consonance of the mood, tone, and style of the influencer with brand</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p><em>Choosing the right influencer for an influencer marketing ad campaign will help us to create a harmonious tandem. </em></p>

                        <p>&nbsp;</p>

                        <h2>6. Review the campaign</h2>

                        <p>Review and analyze the content:</p>

                        <ol>
                            <li>What an influencer will publish</li>
                            <li>How they&#39;ll communicate with subscriber</li>
                            <li>Review selected audience</li>
                            <li>Number of advertising posts and collaboration with other brands - an excessive amount of advertising reduces the level of engagement and trust</li>
                        </ol>
